# 002 - Mosaic Smash

This was my first BIAB and I did not take enough notes.

```
2.5kg Maris Otter.
50g Mosaic, unknown schedule.
```

I failed to chill the beer quickly enough after the boil and pitched yeast at 35-40 C. The beer successfully fermented but was extremely cloudy afterwards. When bottling there was a strong mango smell, very little flavour, some sweetness and some chemical taste.
