### Notes

 - This was meant to be a Smash with Maris Otter, but the shop didn't have any. They were low on Extra Pale malt, so I had to get some Vienna too.
 - I was waiting for the hot break before adding the first hop addition, but I'm finding it very hard to see when the hot break occurs. There's lots of floaty proteins throughout the brew, but the foam definitely died down a bit just before the first hop addition.
 - This is the first time I'm using petroleum jelly in the fermenter threads. Hopefully we'll see some bubbling action and won't have any oxidation!
