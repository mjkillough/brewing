### Notes

 - Recipe from [The Mad Fermentationist](https://www.themadfermentationist.com/2009/11/hoppy-french-saison.html).
 - Yeast was hydrated in cup of cool water (°C) that was previously boiled.
 - First time using the BrewBucket Mini. The rubber bung slipped through into wort and I had to santize a long spoon to fish it out.
 - Auto-siphon to rack from kettle to fermenter kicks up way too much sediment - this is especially troubling now that I'm limited to ~2.5 gallons in the fermenter

## Bottling

FG of 1.012 reached on 2020-01-20, giving 4.2% ABV. This then sat in the fermenter until 2020-03-11 when it was bottled. Primed with 73g of sugar to give 2.8 volumes of CO2 (temperature 18°C)

## Drinking

Tasty! Not as yeasty/aromatic as previous Saison, but quite clean. Relatively clear, but no as clear as the first brew. Slight spicy after-taste... difficult to tell whether that's the carbonation or actual spice.

Mixed reviews from others who drank it.
