### Notes

 - Hot day, brewing with the door open.
 - Wanted to do a 30 min boil, but had already measured out 16L.
 - Brew bag screwed up, putting malt into the wort. Used sieve while heating up to boil to remove grain.
 - Used trivets under pot while cooling to avoid hot hobs from re-heating wort.
